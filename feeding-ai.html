                        <h2>Abstract</h2>
                        <p>The article focused on the overlooked effort behind AI's rapid development, highlighting the role of AI annotators, also known as "<em>ghost workers</em>” in the industry. </p>
                        <p>AI annotators are people spending long hours performing repetitive, high-focus tasks like labeling images and transcribing audio. The role is vital for training machine learning models, but the workers themselves experience low pay, little job security, and health issues. </p>
                        <p>Potential reasons that make workers feel less secure include skimming from various outsourcing layers, as well as the possibility of being replaced by automation. </p>
