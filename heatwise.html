                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>Environmental science education lacks an engaging and accessible digital learning tool that effectively supports both educators and students. </p>
                        <h2>User Research</h2>
                        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                        <p>9th-12th grade students in Boston Public Schools and their environmental science teachers. </p>
                        <h3>Methods</h3>
                        <p>Focus groups and user interviews were carried out among 11th grade students and their environmental science teachers in Boston Green Academy. </p>
                        <h3>User Interview Highlights</h3>
                        <ul class = 'user-interviews'>
                            <li>Students</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Long lectures about science were overwhelming and disengaging for students.</li>
                                <li>Customization (for example, customizing the appearances of avatars), visualizations, and hands-on experiences could make students feel connected.</li>
                                <li>Learning gaps were found among students.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Educators</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Emphasized engagement and progress over grades.</li>
                                <li>Extended learning curve of some existing tools (for example, story maps) had an impact on usability.</li>
                                <li>Students only have access to Chromebooks in classroom. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Design System</h2>

                        <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
                        <h3>Tracking Community Forest Planting</h3>
                        <p>Miyawaki Method was integrated into Boston Public Schools' environmental science curriculum, enabling students to observe self-sustaining forest ecosystems within their own communities.</p>
                        <img src = 'images/heatwise-datahub.png' alt = 'Before-after mock up comparison of Heatwise data hub on Chrome. ' />
                        <p>A centralized data hub was developed to help teachers collect and visualize information related to the forests planted. The data hub functioned as both an engagement tool and an instructional resource.</p>
                        <p>The assignment submission interface was redesigned with structured input fields and feedback features to streamline the data collection process.</p>
                        <h3>Enhancing Engagement among Students with Varied Knowledge Levels</h3>
                        <img src = 'images/heatwise-progress.png' alt = 'Chrome mock up of Heatwise landingpage and dashboard page on Chrome. ' />
                        <p>Progress trackers were implemented in place of traditional grades, aligning with educators' goals of prioritizing student engagement over evaluation.</p>
                        <p>Customizable characters were adopted from <a href = 'https://idori.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooYTOZRP42f4wu3oSgYr2lGqC0RS6eTomZXrRWYrehUV9-EPkPB'>Idori</a> to create a more personalized and motivating experience through visual identity and companionship.</p>

                        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
                        <h3>Improvements</h3>
                        <img src = 'images/heatwise-navbar.png' alt = 'Mock up comparison of browsing course menu using Heatwise navigation bar. ' />
                        <p>Applied more robust course navigation other than hovering to see the next level of content. </p>

                        <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                        <p>After completing our phase of user research and initial design, the project was handed off to a new UX team for continued refinement and expansion.</p>
                        <h3>UI Improvements</h3>
                        <p>The current interface featured basic visual design and limited branding consistency. Future iterations should prioritize a more unified and polished UI system, with cohesive visual elements and a clearer design language.</p>
                        <h3>Student-End UX Development</h3>
                        <p>While the current version focuses on the teacher-facing experience based on our user research findings, future iterations will shift toward the student end. Specifically, expanding customization options and enhancing visual feedback, such as using a growing digital tree of students' choice to track assignment progress.</p>
