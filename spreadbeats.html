                        <h2>Situation</h2>
                        <p>Despite Spotify's diverse ad solutions, a strategic perception gap within the advertising industry was identified during Spotify's reposition as a multi-format platform. Specifically, media planners, as people offering buying suggestions, continue to overlook Spotify's video advertising offers. </p>
                        <p>This misalignment between Spotify's internal capabilities and external perceptions limits the platform's inclusion in multi-format RFPs, posing a barrier to revenue growth and long-term competitiveness.</p>

                        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                        <p>Media planners constitute the primary target audience for the campaign because they serve as the key decision-makers responsible for executing ad bookings and optimizing media choices to achieve defined advertising goals. </p>
                        <p>Given the analytical and result-oriented nature of their work, B2B communication withmedia planners is often conducted in a rational, information-driven manner. However, prior research shows that emotions meaningfully influence B2B decision-making and sales interactions. Therefore, emotional engagement might play an important role in developing strategies.</p>

                        <h2>Objectives</h2>
                        <h3>Awareness Objective</h3>
                        <p>To increase awareness of Spotify's multi-format advertising solutions by 35% to 40% among media planners across key markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and India, within three months of campaign launch.</p>
                        <h3>Acceptance Objective</h3>
                        <p>To improve positive perception and brand favorability toward Spotify advertising by 25% to 30% within six months, as measured through surveys and qualitative interviews with media planners.</p>
                        <h3>Action Objective</h3>
                        <p>To increase the number of multi-format RFP shortlists by 10% to 15% within one year of campaign launch, tracked through Spotify Ad Sales CRM data.</p>

                        <h2>Programming</h2>
                        <h3>Key Message</h3>
                        <p>Spotify offers multi-format ads that can create interactive and engaging experiences rather than having audio-only solutions.</p>
                        <h3>Strategies and Tactics</h3>

                        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
                        <p>The follow-up monitoring encompassed digital news, professional networks such as LinkedIn, and advertising-industry forums where media planners actively exchange information. Metrics analyzed included total digital reach, mention volume, geographic distribution, sentiment trends, and practitioner-level engagement signals.</p>
                        <h3>Awareness</h3>
                        <ul id = 'evaluation'>

                                <li><em>Spreadbeats</em> received multiple major creative awards. The Excel-embedded music video achieved an 870% increase in ad engagement compared with previous B2B paid campaigns. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Supplemental Evidence (MeltWater)</li>  
                            <ul>
                                <li>Industry-level visibility: Widespread coverage was generated, accumulating 2,130 global news mentions and a 33% rise in overall digital reach, totaling 2.05 billion impressions. The United States, the United Kingdom, and India were the most active markets, with more than 400 U.S. mentions referencing Spotify Advertising.</li>
                                <li>Practitioner-level visibility: More than 600 LinkedIn interactions and over 100 conversations across advertising communities and agency forums. </li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Practitioner-level visibility: Positive sentiment toward Spotify Advertising increased from 11.8% in 2023 to 29.8% after the campaign. On LinkedIn, where no sentiment was recorded in 2023, 22.9% of posts were positive rather than neutral after the campaign was launched.</li>
                            </ul>

                        </ul>
                        


                        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                        <p><em>Spreadbeats</em> successfully generates significant visibility, emotional engagement, and peer-driven conversation across awareness, acceptance, and action levels with a concrete, memorable video that challenges the audio-only stereotype. </p> 
                        <p>However, there was an absence of sufficient research, measurable objectives, and structured tracking data. The purpose of recommendations is to help Spotify strengthen its long-term positioning as a multi-format advertising platform in future IMC execution.</p>

                        <h3>Research: Strengthen research and competitor benchmarking</h3>

                            <li>Conduct ongoing social listening across planner-relevant channels.</li>
                            <li>Conduct structured competitor benchmarking, given that planners default to choose other platforms for video investment.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Objectives: Develop clear and measurable objectives aligned with evaluations</h3>
                        <ul id = 'recommendations-list'>
                            <li>Formally define cognitive (awareness), affective (acceptance), and behavioral (action) objectives at the outset of campaign planning.</li>
                            <li>Design brand-tracking surveys and content analysis protocols that are tied to these objectives, allowing pre- and post-campaign comparison.</li>
                            <li>Set realistic benchmarks based on industry norms (e.g., typical B2B email forwarding rates, average brand-lift ranges) to avoid over-claiming impact and to interpret outcomes in context.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Objectives: Develop clear and measurable objectives aligned with evaluations</h3>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Programming: Move from the education-only to the education and enablement phase</h3>
                        <ul id = 'recommendations-list'>
                            <li>Integrate more logos into copywriting.</li>
                            <li>Better showcase pitch-to-performance success stories by increasing the frequency and visibility of case studies across owned media channels.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Evaluation: Build a behavioral measurement system around RFP and sales pipelines</h3>

                            <li>Design evaluation as a before-and-after comparison.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Broaden and prioritize target public groups strategically</h3>
                        <p>Looking beyond the <em>Spreadbeats</em> campaign, the Spotify ads website revealed an open approach to brands and agencies, as well as individual creators and users. While media planners remain the core decision-making public for <em>Spreadbeats</em>, Spotify's broader growth strategy also targets individual creators and small businesses through its self-serve advertising tools.</p>
