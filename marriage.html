                        <h2>Abstract</h2>
                        <p>The article discussed shifting attitudes toward marriage and romance among Chinese youth, highlighting the rise of “partnerships” as an alternative to traditional relationships.</p>
                        <p>Drawing on the Chinese <em>General Social Survey (CGSS)</em>, preferences in partner selection included appearance, education, and financial stability, though gender gaps persist in expectations. Tensions between modern expectations and entrenched gender roles were also worth noticing, particularly in household labor. These gaps are driving youth to seek alternative, low-pressure connections in relationships.</p>
